# Python-To-Do-list-app
Created a Python ToDo Gui App. This app lets users add tasks that they need to finish, or are completed. I used VS Code IDE to code the project and used QtDesigner to make the app. A style sheet was used to make the textboxes with color. When running the files on PC or Mac make sure that you have Python version 3. Also make sure you install Qt designer pkg and PyQt5 pkg installed. Enjoy the app :)
