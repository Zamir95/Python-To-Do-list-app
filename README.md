# Python-To-Do-list-app
Created a Python To-Do list Gui App. This app lets users add tasks that they need to finish, or are completed. For example if the tasks that the user needs to complete are groceries, gardening, pick up food etc they can add those items to the unfinsihed table list. Once they complete the items the user can click the done button and it will move the finished item to finished table task. Lets say the user half completed the task the user can click the unfinished button and move the task from finished to unfinished table and when they get a chance to fully finish the task they can move it back to finished table task. I used VS Code IDE to code the project and used QtDesigner to make the the tables (finished and unfinished task) and buttons. A style sheet was used to make the textboxes with colors and display texts and background colour. When running the files on PC or Mac make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed. Also make sure you install Qt designer pkg and PyQt5 pkg. Enjoy the app :). If you experience any issues please do not hesitate to send me a msg from my website.
